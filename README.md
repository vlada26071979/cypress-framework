## 🔍 About the Project
This repository contains a custom Cypress-based automation testing framework designed to make writing, organizing, and maintaining UI tests easier and cleaner.  
The framework uses a **Page Object Model (POM)** structure and is set up for both **local execution** and **CI/CD integration** via GitHub Actions.

The main goal is to create a scalable, maintainable, and easy-to-understand automation suite that can be extended for any modern web application.
